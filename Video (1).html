<body><h1>How do hardware components like processors, memory, and storage impact the performance of software applications?</h1>
<h2> Having good components</h2>
  <p>
  Having a faster processor means having quicker loading speeds and also being able to have multiple apps and websites open at once. 
  <br>
    <br>
  Having more memory means being able to remeber multiple things at the same time.
  <br>
    <br>
  Having more storage being able to store multiple items on one drive at the same time. 
  </p>
<h2> Having bad components</h2>
    <p>
  Having a slower processor means having much slower loading speeds and not being able to open multiple apps and websites open at once.
    <br>
      <br>
    Having worse memory means the computer not being able to remember 
more things and can result in file corruption.
    <br>
      <br>
    Having worse storage means not being able to store many items on the same drive at once.
