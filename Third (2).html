            <li><strong>1989: The motivation</strong>
                <p>CERN Physicist Tim Berners-Lee needed “a pool of information which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes.”

                <strong>1989: The invention</strong>
                <p>Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, HTTP, and wrote the <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first HTML page</a>.

                <strong>1993: It starts small</strong>
                <p>Berners-Lee presented the WWW at the IETF conference in a small BoF session, which is mentioned in the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/26.pdf">proceedings</a>.</p>

                <p>Berners-Lee founds the W3C to standardize HTML for all browsers to follow.</p>

<h2 id="#CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
  <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
<center><div id = "img_border">  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg/240px-CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" width="200"> </div> </center>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
 <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
<br>
   <br>
For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.</p>
    Without CSS webpages would be pretty boring!
