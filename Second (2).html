<h2> History </h2>
<p>
  Early in the 1970s, Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs developed C as an improved version of Ken Thompson's B. The first C tutorial was written by Brian Kernighan, a different Bell Labs employee, and he convinced Ritchie to collaborate on a book about the programming language. The majority of the book's "expository" content would be written by Kernighan, and Ritchie's reference guide would serve as its appendices.
<br>
  <br>
  The first widely available book on the C programming language was the first edition, which was released on February 22nd, 1978. This early version of C is sometimes referred to as K&R C (after the authors of the book), frequently to distinguish it from the later version of C that was standardized as ANSI C.

<h2> Influence </h2>
  <p>
  Reviewers frequently point to the C programming language as an example of technical writing because of its clear presentation and succinct treatment. Examples typically consist of fully developed programs of the kind one might come across while using the language on a daily basis, with a focus on system programming. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Its authors stated, "We have attempted to maintain the first edition's conciseness. Because C is not a large language, a large book would not be of much use to it. We have improved the explanation of crucial elements that are essential to C programming, like pointers. The initial examples have been improved, and new examples have been added to several chapters. Programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa, for instance, enhance the treatment of complex declarations. Every example, just like before, has been tested directly from the text's machine-readable form.
<br>
    <br>
    As an example of a simple, functional C program, the book provided the "Hello, World!" program, which prints only the phrase "hello, world." Since then, a lot of texts have introduced programming languages in the same way.
